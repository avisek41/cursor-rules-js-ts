# Cursor Rules - Generic Tech Stack

This file contains comprehensive coding rules that apply to any technology stack. These rules are designed to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across all projects.

## How to Use These Rules

1. Copy this `.cursorrules` file to your project root
2. Copy the rule files from the `rules/` folder (code-quality.mdc, documentation.mdc, naming-conventions.mdc) to your project root
3. Cursor will automatically apply these rules when assisting with code

## Rule Categories

### 1. Code Quality (rules/code-quality.mdc)
- Clean code standards
- Error handling
- Security best practices
- Performance considerations
- Code complexity management
- Testing requirements

### 2. Documentation (rules/documentation.mdc)
- Code documentation standards
- README requirements
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Inline comments guidelines

### 3. Naming Conventions (rules/naming-conventions.mdc)
- Variable and function naming
- Class and type naming
- File and directory naming
- Language-specific conventions
- Database and API naming

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused (20-30 lines ideal)
- Handle errors explicitly
- Validate all inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain low complexity
- Write comprehensive tests

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Keep README files comprehensive and up-to-date
- Use appropriate documentation tools
- Include code examples
- Maintain changelogs

### Naming
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Be consistent throughout the codebase
- Avoid abbreviations and generic names
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use `===` instead of `==`
- Prefer async/await over promise chains
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes/interfaces

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use type hints where applicable
- Follow the Zen of Python

### Java
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use camelCase for variables/methods
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Handle checked exceptions appropriately
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Go
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Keep functions small and focused
- Export only what's necessary

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code, ensure:
- [ ] Code follows all naming conventions
- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] README is updated if needed

## Quick Reference

### Function/Method Guidelines
- Maximum length: 50 lines (ideally 20-30)
- Single responsibility
- Clear, descriptive names
- Proper error handling
- Input validation

### Variable Naming
- Descriptive nouns or noun phrases
- Avoid abbreviations
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans (`is`, `has`, `can`)
- Be specific, not generic

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include parameter and return types
- Provide usage examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Keep dependencies updated

## Integration with Projects

To use these rules in a specific project:

1. **Copy the rules**: Copy `.cursorrules` and the `.mdc` files from `rules/` to your project root
2. **Customize if needed**: Add project-specific rules while maintaining these core principles
3. **Team alignment**: Ensure your team is aware of and follows these rules
4. **Code reviews**: Use the checklists during code reviews
5. **CI/CD**: Consider adding linting rules that enforce these standards

## Maintenance

- Review and update rules periodically
- Add language-specific rules as needed
- Keep rules generic and applicable across projects
- Remove outdated or conflicting rules
- Document any project-specific exceptions

---

**Note**: These rules are designed to be generic and applicable to any technology stack. Customize them for your specific project needs while maintaining the core principles.
