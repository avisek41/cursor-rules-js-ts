# Cursor Rules - TypeScript/JavaScript

Comprehensive rules for **TS/JS** projects: **React**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **React Native**. Code quality, maintainability, consistency, and AI-assisted development workflow.



## How to Use These Rules

1. Copy this `.cursorrules` file to your project root
2. Copy the rule files into `.cursor/rules/` (see Rule Categories below)
3. Cursor will automatically apply these rules when assisting with code

## 🎯 Global Rule Application

**These rules are ALWAYS applied automatically when the user asks to:**
- `review` / `code review` / `check this`
- `refactor` / `restructure`
- `improve` / `enhance` / `make better` / `clean this up`
- `clean` / `clean up` / `cleanup`
- `fix` / `debug` / `solve` / `repair`
- `optimize` / `performance` / `make faster`
- `rename` / `better names`
- `document` / `add docs` / `write docs` / `comment this`
- `create` / `build` / `implement` / `add` / `make`
- `update` / `modify` / `change` / `edit`
- `test` / `add tests` / `write tests`
- `validate` / `check` / `verify`
- `explain` / `describe` / `how does this work` / `what does this do`
- `analyze` / `assess`

**The user does NOT need to mention "rules", "standards", or "best practices" explicitly.**

### Automatic Rule Application by Request Type

| User Says | Auto-Apply These Rules | Action Priority |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| `review this` | ALL rules (quality + naming + docs) | 1. Critical bugs<br>2. Quality violations<br>3. Naming issues<br>4. Missing docs/tests |
| `refactor this` | Code quality + Naming + Modern patterns | Keep changes small, apply DRY/SOLID |
| `improve this` | ALL rules | Same as review |
| `create [feature]` | AI-dev workflow → Quality | **STOP**: Plan first, confirm, then implement in steps |
| `fix [bug]` | AI-dev workflow + Quality | Understand → Propose fix → Implement → Add test |
| `document this` | Documentation + Naming | JSDoc for public APIs, explain WHY not WHAT |
| `optimize this` | Code quality (performance) | Profile first, avoid premature optimization |
| `add tests` | Code quality (testing) | Test business logic, edge cases, errors |

### Enforcement Rules

**When user says "review" or "improve":**
✅ Automatically check against:
- Functions <50 lines (ideal 20-30)
- No magic numbers/strings (use constants)
- No code duplication (DRY)
- Proper error handling (never silent failures)
- No `any` in TypeScript (use `unknown` + type guards)
- Meaningful names (no abbreviations, descriptive)
- Max 3-4 function parameters (use config object if more)
- Input validation at boundaries
- Accessibility (semantic HTML, testID for React Native)

**When user says "create" or "build":**
1. ⚠️ **STOP - Don't code immediately**
2. Propose step-by-step plan (bullet list)
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Implement in small steps (~20-30 lines per change)
5. For new features: Create skeleton/structure first, confirm placement, then add logic

**When user says "refactor":**
- Apply SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
- Extract duplication
- Simplify complexity (max 10 cyclomatic complexity)
- Improve naming
- Keep each change small and reviewable
- ❌ Do NOT refactor working legacy code outside the task scope

**When user says "fix":**
1. Understand root cause
2. Propose fix approach
3. Implement with proper error handling
4. Suggest adding test to prevent regression

## Rule Categories

Rules in `.cursor/rules/` are applied automatically.

### 1. AI-Assisted Development (.cursor/rules/ai-assisted-development.mdc)
- Plan before coding; implement in small, reviewable steps
- Validate structure first for new features (skeleton then logic)
- Re-plan when something feels off; don’t refactor legacy out of scope
- Review checklist: layer, naming, i18n, no hardcoded values, types, a11y

### 2. Code Quality (.cursor/rules/code-quality.mdc)
- Clean code standards
- Error handling
- Security best practices
- Performance considerations
- Code complexity management
- Testing requirements

### 3. Documentation (.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc)
- Code documentation standards
- README requirements
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Inline comments guidelines

### 4. Naming Conventions (.cursor/rules/naming-conventions.mdc)
- Variable and function naming
- Class and type naming
- File and directory naming
- Language-specific conventions
- Database and API naming

### 5. TypeScript Patterns (.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc)
- Type safety: avoid `any`, use `unknown` and type guards; strict mode; interface vs type
- Discriminated unions for complex state
- Utility types: Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, ReturnType, etc.
- Generics: constraints, default params, avoid over-engineering
- Advanced: `as const`, `satisfies`, readonly, template literal types

### 6. Modern JS/TS Patterns (.cursor/rules/modern-js-ts-patterns.mdc)
- Async/await over promise chains; Promise.all / allSettled; no async in forEach
- Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Destructuring for params and defaults; map/filter/reduce, some/every, find/findIndex

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused (20-30 lines ideal)
- Handle errors explicitly
- Validate all inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain low complexity
- Write comprehensive tests

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Keep README files comprehensive and up-to-date
- Use appropriate documentation tools
- Include code examples
- Maintain changelogs

### Naming
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Be consistent throughout the codebase
- Avoid abbreviations and generic names
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use `===` instead of `==`
- Prefer async/await over promise chains
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes/interfaces

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use type hints where applicable
- Follow the Zen of Python

### Java
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use camelCase for variables/methods
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Handle checked exceptions appropriately
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Go
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Keep functions small and focused
- Export only what's necessary

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded values

### Variable Naming
- Descriptive nouns or noun phrases
- Avoid abbreviations
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans (`is`, `has`, `can`)
- Be specific, not generic

- Provide usage examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Keep dependencies updated

## Integration with Projects

To use these rules in a specific project:

1. **Copy the rules**: Copy `.cursorrules` to project root and the `.mdc` files into `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Customize if needed**: Add project-specific rules while maintaining these core principles
3. **Team alignment**: Ensure your team is aware of and follows these rules
4. **Code reviews**: Use the checklists during code reviews
5. **CI/CD**: Consider adding linting rules that enforce these standards

## Maintenance

- Review and update rules periodically
- Add language-specific rules as needed
- Keep rules generic and applicable across projects
- Remove outdated or conflicting rules
- Document any project-specific exceptions

**Note**: These rules target TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Angular, Node.js, React Native). Customize for your project while keeping the core principles.
