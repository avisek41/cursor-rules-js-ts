# Cursor Rules - TypeScript/JavaScript

Comprehensive rules for **TS/JS** projects: **React**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **React Native**. Code quality, maintainability, consistency, and AI-assisted development workflow.

## How to Use These Rules

1. Copy this `.cursorrules` file to your project root
2. Copy the rule files into `.cursor/rules/` (see Rule Categories below)
3. Cursor will automatically apply these rules when assisting with code

## Rule Categories

Rules in `.cursor/rules/` are applied automatically.

### 1. AI-Assisted Development (.cursor/rules/ai-assisted-development.mdc)
- Plan before coding; implement in small, reviewable steps
- Validate structure first for new features (skeleton then logic)
- Re-plan when something feels off; don’t refactor legacy out of scope
- Review checklist: layer, naming, i18n, no hardcoded values, types, a11y

### 2. Code Quality (.cursor/rules/code-quality.mdc)
- Clean code standards
- Error handling
- Security best practices
- Performance considerations
- Code complexity management
- Testing requirements

### 3. Documentation (.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc)
- Code documentation standards
- README requirements
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Inline comments guidelines

### 4. Naming Conventions (.cursor/rules/naming-conventions.mdc)
- Variable and function naming
- Class and type naming
- File and directory naming
- Language-specific conventions
- Database and API naming

### 5. TypeScript Patterns (.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc)
- Type safety: avoid `any`, use `unknown` and type guards; strict mode; interface vs type
- Discriminated unions for complex state
- Utility types: Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, ReturnType, etc.
- Generics: constraints, default params, avoid over-engineering
- Advanced: `as const`, `satisfies`, readonly, template literal types

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused (20-30 lines ideal)
- Handle errors explicitly
- Validate all inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Maintain low complexity
- Write comprehensive tests

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Keep README files comprehensive and up-to-date
- Use appropriate documentation tools
- Include code examples
- Maintain changelogs

### Naming
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Follow language-specific conventions
- Be consistent throughout the codebase
- Avoid abbreviations and generic names
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use `===` instead of `==`
- Prefer async/await over promise chains
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Follow camelCase for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes/interfaces

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use type hints where applicable
- Follow the Zen of Python

### Java
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use camelCase for variables/methods
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Handle checked exceptions appropriately
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Go
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Keep functions small and focused
- Export only what's necessary

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code, ensure:
- [ ] Code follows all naming conventions
- [ ] All public APIs are documented
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Input validation is present
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Tests are included and passing
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] README is updated if needed

## Quick Reference

### AI-Assisted Development (one-line takeaway)
- **Align on a plan first, then implement in small, reviewable steps**—minimizes rework and keeps code clean and maintainable.

### Function/Method Guidelines
- Maximum length: 50 lines (ideally 20-30)
- Single responsibility
- Clear, descriptive names
- Proper error handling
- Input validation

### Variable Naming
- Descriptive nouns or noun phrases
- Avoid abbreviations
- Use appropriate prefixes for booleans (`is`, `has`, `can`)
- Be specific, not generic

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include parameter and return types
- Provide usage examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Keep dependencies updated

## Integration with Projects

To use these rules in a specific project:

1. **Copy the rules**: Copy `.cursorrules` to project root and the `.mdc` files into `.cursor/rules/`
2. **Customize if needed**: Add project-specific rules while maintaining these core principles
3. **Team alignment**: Ensure your team is aware of and follows these rules
4. **Code reviews**: Use the checklists during code reviews
5. **CI/CD**: Consider adding linting rules that enforce these standards

## Maintenance

- Review and update rules periodically
- Add language-specific rules as needed
- Keep rules generic and applicable across projects
- Remove outdated or conflicting rules
- Document any project-specific exceptions

**Note**: These rules target TypeScript/JavaScript (React, Angular, Node.js, React Native). Customize for your project while keeping the core principles.
